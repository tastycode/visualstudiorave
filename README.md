# Code Rave 

This folder contains a VS Code extension which serves a page (code.html)
which receives the current editor text from VSCode. The intent is to
create a canvas where code can be mixed with anything available to the
browser, such as music visualization.


## Next steps

- [  ] Allow sending and receiving midi messages from the extension to
  control Ableton and VDMX/COGE

## Running the Sample

* `npm install` to initialize the project
* `npm run watch` to start the compiler in watch mode
* open this folder in VS Code and press `F5`
* this will open the `[Extension Development Host]` window, running the extension:
* find some file to edit (that's unfortunately not the extension itself)
* visit localhost:3069
